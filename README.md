## Description

The app has a clean and minimal interface with an input field to enter a search term and a button to look up the word. It uses the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to get definitions and audio pronunciations of the searched word. 

Once a term is searched, the app displays the word, its meaning, and an audio player to play the audio clip of the pronunciation. The meaning is fetched from the API and displayed clearly.
