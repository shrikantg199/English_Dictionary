# English Dictionary 📖

A simple and elegant dictionary web app that allows you to instantly search for meanings and pronunciations of English words. 

## Description

The app has a clean and minimal interface with an input field to enter a search term and a button to look up the word. It uses the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to get definitions and audio pronunciations of the searched word. 

Once a term is searched, the app displays the word, its meaning, and an audio player to play the audio clip of the pronunciation. The meaning is fetched from the API and displayed clearly.

The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. The simple and intuitive interface allows for easy search of any English word.
